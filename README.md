# AI1110 â€“ Probability and Random Variables

A Python-based project exploring key probability concepts through **simulations and geometric reasoning**, built as part of the AI1110 course.

---

## Overview

This project uses **Monte Carlo methods** and **visualization** to solve and understand problems that are hard to approach analytically.

### Key Simulations:
- **Modified Monty Hall (5 Doors)**:  
  Simulates strategy outcomes with switch/stick choices using uniform probability.

- **Triangle Containment Test**:  
  Random points on a circle are checked to see if they form a triangle containing the center.

##  Methods Used

- Monte Carlo simulations (10,000+ trials)
- Geometric  analysis
- Empirical vs theoretical probability comparison
